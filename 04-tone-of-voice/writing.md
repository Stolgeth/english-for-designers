Hey there, it's Tomáš again! Today, I want to dive into something that's become a big part of who I am: my tone of voice. Over the years, I've crafted a communication style that's approachable, authentic, and always striving to make a connection. It's a bit like my secret recipe, but instead of whipping up a tasty dish, I'm serving up words that'll make you feel right at home.

Now, developing this tone of voice didn't happen overnight. It's been a journey of self-discovery and lots of trial and error. But a few years ago, something clicked, and I realized that the way I communicate is a direct reflection of my personality.

So, what does my tone of voice actually sound like? Well, imagine if your best friend was also a designer with a knack for witty one-liners. (And given my audience, that probably is the case) That's pretty much me in a nutshell. I like to keep things casual, as if we're just hanging out and chatting about life, design, and everything in between. I find that when I'm authentic and let my personality shine through, it creates a much more engaging and memorable experience for everyone involved.

Of course, I know when to dial it back a notch and put on my "professional" hat. But even in business settings, I still try to maintain that friendly and approachable vibe. After all, who says work can't be fun? (Well, maybe some of my old clients, but that's another story.)

The best part about having a consistent tone of voice is that it helps me build stronger, more genuine relationships. Whether I'm collaborating with clients or just joking around with friends, people know what to expect from me. They can count on me to be honest, relatable, and maybe even crack a smile or two along the way.

But don't just take my word for it. As someone once said, "We are what we do." And I'd like to think that by consistently communicating in a way that's true to myself, I'm not just talking the talk, but walking the walk. (Or in this case, typing the type? Okay, that one needs some work.)

My tone of voice is more than just a communication style – it's an extension of who I am. It's the way I connect with the world around me and leave my mark on everything I create. And if it happens to make people feel more at ease or even brighten their day, well, that's just the cherry on top. So, there you have it. That's how I found my voice and why I stick to it like glue. It wasn't always easy, but now it comes as second nature.
