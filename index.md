#### Year in review. 
What a wild ride the last 12 months have been. It's been a year of pushing boundaries, chasing dreams, and juggling more plates than I eat when I am bulking. 

First up, I took a leap of faith and enrolled at VŠKK to do a speedrun of the school. I am talking 3 years crammed into 1, plus the final work. It's like playing life on hard mode, but you know me - I never back down from a challenge.

Before diving into the academic deep end, I was "killing it" as a creative director at a marketing agency. But you know what they say - sometimes you gotta shake things up to level up. And I realized I am not too keen on working in advertising, but I do like marketing still. 

Speaking of leveling up, I finally smashed through the 450kg overall in my gym goals. We're talking 150kg squat, 200kg deadlift, and 110kg bench. And now, I'm sculpting my summer body like a Renaissance master.

But the real game-changer this year? AI. It's become my ultimate sidekick, helping me navigate every aspect of life. It's like having a genius in your pocket, minus the attitude. So I hope I am a genius squared now?

On the personal front, I've been working on strengthening my bond with my family. Because at the end of the day, that's what really matters, right?

Oh, and just to keep things spicy, my apartment decided to take a swim last week. Yep, flooded. Just another day in life.

I'm not gonna lie, juggling work, school, personal life, and fitness has been a wild juggling act. But you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. Sure, I might not be operating at 100% capacity all the time, but that's just part of the journey. So, here's to another year of growth, challenges, and never settling for ordinary.
