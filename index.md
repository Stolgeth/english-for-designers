## Hi! I am Tomáš Trlíček your DiS.Grafik
As a Creative Director with over seven years in visual arts, I specialize in creating visual identities, essential for branding and marketing evolution. With extensive experience in web design and optimization, my interests include design, UI/UX, marketing, psychology, and personal development. I follow the Bauhaus principle of "form follows function," ensuring my work is aesthetically pleasing, timeless, and practical for real-world use.
