# About me

**As a Creative director with more than seven years of experience in visual arts,** my true passion lies in crafting visual identities. I hold a firm belief that the **visual identity forms the essence of a brand**. This belief drives my commitment to both the creation of branding and its marketing evolution.

My experience spans several years in **designing and optimizing websites for users**. My enthusiasm for learning isn't confined to just design and UI/UX; it also encompasses fields like marketing, psychology, and personal development.

I adhere to the Bauhaus principle that **form follows function**, upholding that my work should not only be aesthetically pleasing and timeless but also straightforward and practical for real-world application.
