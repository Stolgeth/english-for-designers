## Hi! I am Tomáš Trlíček your DiS.Grafik
### (You were born with it, I studied to get here!)

![Profile Pircture](https://github.com/Stolgeth/english-for-designers/assets/133216768/28e6038b-529e-428e-9811-f4db8209a9e9)


## About me

**As a Creative Director with more than seven years of experience in visual arts,** my true passion lies in crafting visual identities. I hold a firm belief that the **visual identity forms the essence of a brand**. This belief drives my commitment to both the creation of branding and its marketing evolution.

My experience spans several years in **designing and optimizing websites for users**. My enthusiasm for learning isn't confined to just design and UI/UX; it also encompasses fields like marketing, psychology, and personal development.

I adhere to the Bauhaus principle that **form follows function**, upholding that my work should not only be aesthetically pleasing and timeless but also straightforward and practical for real-world application.

### What usually I get paid for:
- **Creativity** to outstand
- **Visual identity** that survives the test of time
- **Improvisation** or making miracles happen
- **Branding** that transcends the visual
- **Marketing** to capture the mind
- **Strategy** that makes sense for you
- **UI Design** and how we can interact with it
- **UX Optimization** not quite UX Research but almost there
- **UX Copywriting and funneling** how to make people think and do what we need them to do....
- **Business optimization** or how to get your money's worth

### What I enjoy to spend *(my time)* on: 
- Power building
- Fitness plans
- Diets and nutrition experimentation
- Supplementation
- Psychology
- Behavioral science
- Tech Enthusiast
- AI fanatic
- Fantasy and Sci-fi *(DND and Star Wars to be exact!)*
- Character writing and design
- Worldbuilding
- And of course, friends and family

### My origin story: 
When I was about 13 or 14, I began my journey. I wanted to make a cool place for my gamer friends to hang out, but **we needed a profile picture** to show who we are. Later I found out those are logos. People usually pay for that, but I had no money, so **I decided to make it myself.** I had a blast and made something really cool, and that's how I started with graphic designer. I still use that picture for my Discord group to this day!

My first big "job" was in 2018. I volunteered on a project called Hug Day about people from all over the world giving hugs to bring back physical contact. **It was awesome to see my work go global and to realize I could change things with my designs.**

Now, I've been doing this as a job for over 7 years and playing with design stuff for 10 years. It's been an amazing ride!

# My projects: 

## HUGDAY 2023

A revival year of Hug Day, an international hugging event! 
*(It was difficult to hug while keeping 2m distance)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
This is my final thesis and how I earned my DIS. title. I had to design an entire visual style, digital marketing and create strategy. I had to create ideas, think and plan the future of the event and how to make things work. The challanging part was helping with the organizing and dealing with volunteers as well as write my final theses and make the event happen. One of the problems to overcome was to fight off the effects of Covid. 

### TAGS

## Špindleruv Mlýn

Visual identity connected to the people.
*(My personal PTSD project)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
For this project, me and my team had to create a visual identity for a small yet prestigious town. It is known as the place to go skying in Czech republic. We had to reflect the style, people, traditions and history as well as the vision, future and the present of Špindl. The final visual identity and logo reflect all of this.

### TAGS
**Logo** - **City identity** - **Navigation system** - **Necessary printed media**

## Kutná Hora

Design that makes the entire place resonate with music. 
*(Too good for the client, just good enough for 2nd place)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
I was trying to visualize music festival with great history. The Kutná Hore Musical festival is a noble and special place and I wanted to reflect that. The visual style is connected to topograpic style of a map, mixed with soundwaves, that originate from the spots where the musical performances take place.

### TAGS
**Posters** - **Concert visual design** - **Different applications**

## UN1VERS0

Products and goods that are shared in real and virtual meta-universe
*(I made this 1 week before deadline in about 6 hours and somehow it ended up as my crowning project of 2nd year in school)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
For this project, the task was to imagine a fashion brand of the future, therefore I dreamed up a stylish art-piece that you can wear in real life and on your virtual avatar in the metaverse. This unique and personalized piece of warderobe is the unique and special expression of each and every single wearer linking the virtual and the real in one UNIVERSE. 

### TAGS
**Clothing branding** - **Naming** - **NFT** - **Visual identity**

## Ministry of Justice

Just, the right logo for the most just part of the government.
*(The competition was cancelled, but I am confident I had it!)*

### Challanges to overcome:
For this project, I tried to overdeliver on the logo. Not only to create a symbol perfect for Czech Republic's Justice department. I wanted to add an element that could be used across all the parts of Czech government. Turns out most difficult part was creating and stylizing a lion. 

### TAGS
**Logo design** - **Visual presentations**
