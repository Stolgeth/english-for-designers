As an Art Director with over 6 years of experience, creating visual identities is a passion of mine. I believe that visual identity is the core of a brand, and therefore, I dedicate myself not only to branding creation but also to its marketing development. For several years, I have been involved in creating and optimizing websites for users. My passion for education extends beyond design and UI/UX to include marketing, psychology, and personal development. 
I follow the Bauhaus motto - form follows function. I believe my work should be not only aesthetic and timeless but also simple to use in the real world.
