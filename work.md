# My projects: 

## HUGDAY 2023

A revival year of Hug Day, an international hugging event! 
*(It was difficult to hug while keeping 2m distance)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
This is my final thesis and how I earned my DIS. title. I had to design an entire visual style, digital marketing and create strategy. I had to create ideas, think and plan the future of the event and how to make things work. The challanging part was helping with the organizing and dealing with volunteers as well as write my final theses and make the event happen. One of the problems to overcome was to fight off the effects of Covid.

## Špindleruv Mlýn

Visual identity connected to the people.
*(My personal PTSD project)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
For this project, me and my team had to create a visual identity for a small yet prestigious town. It is known as the place to go skying in Czech republic. We had to reflect the style, people, traditions and history as well as the vision, future and the present of Špindl. The final visual identity and logo reflect all of this.

## Kutná Hora

Design that makes the entire place resonate with music. 
*(Too good for the client, just good enough for 2nd place)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
I was trying to visualize music festival with great history. The Kutná Hore Musical festival is a noble and special place and I wanted to reflect that. The visual style is connected to topograpic style of a map, mixed with soundwaves, that originate from the spots where the musical performances take place.

## UN1VERS0

Products and goods that are shared in real and virtual meta-universe
*(I made this 1 week before deadline in about 6 hours and somehow it ended up as my crowning project of 2nd year in school)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
For this project, the task was to imagine a fashion brand of the future, therefore I dreamed up a stylish art-piece that you can wear in real life and on your virtual avatar in the metaverse. This unique and personalized piece of warderobe is the unique and special expression of each and every single wearer linking the virtual and the real in one UNIVERSE.

## Ministry of Justice

Just, the right logo for the most just part of the government.
*(The competition was cancelled, but I am confident I had it!)*

### Challanges to overcome:
For this project, I tried to overdeliver on the logo. Not only to create a symbol perfect for Czech Republic's Justice department. I wanted to add an element that could be used across all the parts of Czech government. Turns out most difficult part was creating and stylizing a lion.
