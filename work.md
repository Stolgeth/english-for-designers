## HUGDAY 2023

A revival year of Hug Day, an international hugging event! 
*(It was difficult to hug while keeping 2m distance)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
In my final thesis for my DIS title, I developed a comprehensive visual style and digital marketing strategy for a major event. Balancing the coordination of volunteers, event organization, and thesis writing posed a significant challenge, particularly in the face of Covid-19’s impacts. This project was not just about planning; it was about bringing a visionary event to life against all odds.

## Špindleruv Mlýn

Visual identity connected to the people.
*(My personal PTSD project)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
In this project, my team and I were tasked with crafting a visual identity for a renowned, yet quaint town, celebrated as a premier skiing destination in the Czech Republic. Our challenge was to encapsulate the essence of Špindlerův Mlýn — affectionately known as Špindl — blending its rich traditions, vibrant community, and historical depth with its contemporary flair and future aspirations. The culmination of our efforts is a visual identity and logo that vividly embody the spirit of Špindl. (The logo isea is all me tho!)

## Kutná Hora

Design that makes the entire place resonate with music. 
*(Too good for the client, just good enough for 2nd place)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
I envisioned a music festival steeped in rich history. The Kutná Hora Musical Festival isn't just an event; it's a unique and prestigious experience. In designing its visual style, I drew inspiration from the precise art of topographic maps, blending them seamlessly with sound waves. These waves ripple out from the very locations where the musical magic happens, creating a symphony of sight and sound that truly captures the festival's essence.

## UN1VERS0

Products and goods that are shared in real and virtual meta-universe
*(I made this 1 week before deadline in about 6 hours and somehow it ended up as my crowning project of 2nd year in school)*

### Challanges to overcome: 
For this project, we were challenged to envision a fashion brand of the future. The result is a fusion of style and technology: a chic, wearable art-piece designed for both real-life and your virtual avatar in the metaverse. This exclusive and personalized wardrobe item embodies the essence of each wearer, seamlessly blending the virtual and the real into one harmonious UNIVERSE.

## Ministry of Justice

Just, the right logo for the most just part of the government.
*(The competition was cancelled, but I am confident I had it!)*

### Challanges to overcome:
For this project, I aimed to exceed expectations with the logo design, crafting a symbol that not only epitomizes the essence of the Czech Republic's Justice Department but also introduces an element versatile enough for use throughout the entire Czech government. The most challenging aspect? Masterfully creating and stylizing a lion that embodies our vision.
